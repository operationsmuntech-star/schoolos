## Deployment Pipeline

### How Your Changes Get to Production

```
1. Local Development
   └─ You edit files in static/ and templates/

2. Commit & Push
   └─ git push origin master (goes to GitHub)

3. Railway Webhook Trigger
   └─ GitHub notifies Railway about new commit

4. Railway Deployment Process
   a) Clone repository from GitHub
   b) Install dependencies (requirements.txt)
   c) Run Procfile release phase:
      └─ python manage.py migrate
      └─ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   d) Start web process:
      └─ gunicorn serving /staticfiles/* via WhiteNoise

5. Live on Production
   └─ https://muntechschoolsys.up.railway.app/
```

### Why `staticfiles/` is in .gitignore

```
.gitignore line 38: staticfiles/

Reason:
- staticfiles/ is GENERATED by Django's collectstatic command
- Copying it to Git wastes space and causes merge conflicts
- Railway always regenerates it during deployment
- Local staticfiles/ copy is only for testing locally
```

### Static Files Resolution

**Development (DEBUG=True):**
```
Django directly serves from: /static/css/auth.css
Actual file location: static/css/auth.css
No collectstatic needed
```

**Production (DEBUG=False, Railway):**
```
Browser requests: /static/css/auth.css
WhiteNoise middleware serves from: staticfiles/css/auth.css
Source: static/css/auth.css (copied by collectstatic)
```

## How to Monitor Deployment

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Select your project: "schoolsys"
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Watch commit `35d7e3d` deploy (2-5 minutes)
5. Status changes: Building → Deploying → Success

### Option 2: Check Your Website
1. Go to https://muntechschoolsys.up.railway.app/accounts/login/
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
3. Look for new earth-tone design

### Option 3: View Logs
```bash
# On Railway dashboard:
- Click "Logs" tab
- Filter: "release phase"
- Look for: "Collecting static files... 142 static files collected"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Visible

**1. Browser Cache Issue**
```
Solution: Hard refresh Ctrl+Shift+R
Or: Open DevTools → Network tab → Disable cache
```

**2. Railway Still Deploying**
```
Check Railway dashboard - Status should be "Success"
Wait 2-5 minutes if still "Building"
```

**3. Check Production collectstatic Ran**
```
Railway Logs → search for "collectstatic"
Should see: "Collecting static files... XXX static files collected"
```

**4. Verify Files Copied**
```
SSH into Railway container and run:
ls -la /app/staticfiles/css/
```

### Settings Issues

**Check config/settings.py:**
```python
# ✅ Correct settings:
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.StaticFilesStorage'  # Production

# If using DEBUG=True in production:
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage'
```

**Check Procfile:**
```
✅ Must have: python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
Currently has: ✅ Correct
```

### How Static Files Flow

```
Development:
  URL: /static/css/auth.css
  ↓
  Django StaticFilesStorage
  ↓
  Direct serve from: static/css/auth.css

Production (Railway):
  URL: /static/css/auth.css
  ↓
  WhiteNoise middleware
  ↓
  Serves from: staticfiles/css/auth.css
  (which was copied from static/css/auth.css during collectstatic)
```

## Design Decisions Explained

### Why Earth Tones?
- ✅ School-like, trustworthy, professional
- ✅ Natural African aesthetic (requested)
- ✅ Better accessibility than bright gradients
- ✅ More readable on mobile devices

### Why Single-Column Layout?
- ✅ Faster loading (no hero animation)
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Better for focus (clear login purpose)
- ✅ Simpler HTML structure

### Why Larger Inputs?
- ✅ Better UX for touch devices
- ✅ Improved accessibility (WCAG AAA)
- ✅ Clearer visual hierarchy
- ✅ Easier to tap on mobile

### Why Remove Split-Screen?
- ✅ Reduced complexity = faster loading
- ✅ Simpler for schools/education context
- ✅ Better mobile experience
- ✅ Cleaner, more professional look

## Performance Impact

### CSS Load Times
- `auth.css`: 715 lines (~8KB gzipped)
- `premium.css`: 658 lines (~12KB gzipped)
- `dark-theme.css`: 370 lines (~4KB gzipped)
- **Total:** ~24KB gzipped (minimal impact)

### Animation Performance
- All animations use CSS (`@keyframes`)
- GPU-accelerated (`transform`, `opacity`)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support for accessibility
- No JavaScript animations (faster)

### Bundle Size
- No additional dependencies
- Pure CSS + vanilla JavaScript
- Uses system fonts (no web font downloads)
- Optimized for Railway's free tier

## Support & Debugging

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# View last commit
git log -1 --stat

# See what's being deployed
git diff HEAD~1 static/

# Force collectstatic locally
.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py collectstatic --clear --noinput

# Test locally with production settings
DEBUG=False python manage.py runserver
```
